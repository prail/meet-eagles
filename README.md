# Meet Eagles

A dating app written in Ada (for fun) that will connect PCC students with
each other through various front ends. Perhaps Instagram as a front-end
or some other, not really sure what else.

### Project goals include, but are not limited to:
- Don't be super intrusive
- Offer minimum features to get people to hang out in-person
- Make people spend more time together than in the app
- Get CS students more dates

### Planned features:
- Signup should be as easy as giving the app your phone number and student ID
- Simple Tinder/Hinge like behavior for matching. (Swipe left and right to get matches)

## Why did I choose Ada?

The reason for writing the backend in Ada is entirely resume driven,
I want to get a job in the defense and government contract industry
and already have experience writing PL/SQL which is Ada-adjacent,
so the backend is going to be written in Ada. Also, I don't think people
expect Ada (the government specced systems dev language) to be the backend
for a dating web-app of all things.

## How can I build and run this?

First, you will need to install [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/) a
toolchain and package manager for Ada.
